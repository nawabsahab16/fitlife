## ❓ Problem

In today’s fast-paced world, people struggle to find time, motivation, and structured guidance for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Existing apps are often too complex, cluttered, or lack personalization. Most fitness platforms either focus on workouts or diet, but not both, and often neglect engaging UI and accessibility.
